      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This was a project done in CAP3104, and my group made a UCF Student-only alternative to services like Facebook Marketplace. 
		We created a website for this purpose, and went through developing requirements, testing, and user research.

      <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>User Research - Valuable experience was gained letting users go through the website, and collecting feedback.</li>
        <li>Developing Requirements - Figuring out everything we needed for a functional Marketplace website was something I did not have experience in beforehand. </li>
